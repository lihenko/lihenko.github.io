                        I appreciated the thoroughness and professionalism of the pre-work assessment with Conrad, the good communication with office staff on progress and scheduling, and the quality and timeliness of the work that was done. The crew also did a thorough cleanup at the end of the project. I must admit it was emotionally hard for me to lose some of the trees I've lived with for over 25 years, and I'm still adjusting to some “holes” in the skyscape, so I also appreciated that Sitkum isn't a “scorched earth” style business, and we carefully planned what needed to happen and how, without going off the deep end. All in all, I'd highly recommend Sitkum Tree Service to friends, and in fact already have.

                        We give Sitkum Tree Service our highest possible ratings.<br>
                        Conor and his crew are professional, knowledgeable woodsmen. They showed up on time for the removal job with great attitudes, and all the proper equipment to remove our dying white pine tree. They worked together well as a team and their post tree removal clean up was exemplary; after a full days work you couldn’t tell anything had even been there— the stump was ground, the logs removed, the yard raked, and any errant chips were blown from the driveway. The crew even removed two dead limbs from our old cherry tree while they were at it.<br>
                        If you need an arborist to consult with or any kind of tree removal, do not hesitate to give Sitkum a call, I guarantee you will be delighted with the job they do.

                        Sitkum Tree Service is awesome. From our first phone call to the office, to Conor's visit for a proposal, to the removal crew working for 2-1/2 days -- this whole team is impressive. Sitkum removed about 33 dead and dying alders along our property line, taking care to avoid damage to the neighbor's healthy cedar trees across the fence. The crew was a pleasure to have on our property (and didn't seem to mind us watching from our camp chairs.) They worked efficiently and safely, and left our property looking immaculate, with extra brush and old stump removal and exceptional cleanup. At every step, they did what they said they would do, WHEN they said they would do it. We highly recommend Sitkum!

                        Sitkum is amazing! They are professional, talented, friendly and extremely capable. The crew of five worked seamlessly together, especially in matters of safety. They did immaculate work, answered questions, put up with observation and went above and beyond.<br>
                        The work was flawless from start to finish, with no wasted motion, effort or time. They came, they did their jobs, cleaned up wonderfully and were away. I would give the highest reccomendation to this company and it's people from initial visit, quote, follow through and completion.

The entire team worked with a craftsmanlike approach. Site was clean when they left; and the project was low impact. Highly recommended, will work with Sitkum Tree Service again in the future.

                        We hired Sitkum Tree Service for a large and difficult project on our property. The task included the removal of over 60 trees, many of which were quite large and uncomfortably close to our home. While it was a nail-biter for us to watch, every tree came down exactly where they intended. More difficult trees were climbed and taken down in sections. They were fast, efficient, professional, and the work was completed in less than three days. They have high-end equipment, are experts in its use, and the owner is an ISA certified arborist, which was important to us. They also left us with a wonderful supply of wood chips for our landscaping. I highly recommend this company.

                        We LOVE Sitkum Tree Service. Over the past three years they have TRANSFORMED our property. When we first bought our house on five acres there was so much to do... Sitkum Tree Service came to the rescue. First, they took down the huge hazardous fir tree behind the house, as well as a row of over-gown Lombardi poplar trees, cleaned up the drive way, and (my favorite) pruned and spruced up our 80 foot oak tree next to our house. The next year they came to the property and selectively edited more of our forest, pruned our beautiful cherry tree out back and removed a dying cherry tree next to it. This year they created a habitat snag, edited along our property line to give us more light, pruned our apple tree, and cleared space for our chicken coop. WE ARE SO HAPPY with their work. This crew of hardworking, kind, professional, and SAFE guys get the job done with a good attitude, attention to detail, and excellent craftsmanship. We can’t wait to have them back and keep thinking of more ways they would be able to help us make our property shine.<br>
                        If you need tree work done you want this crew to do it.<br>
                        Thank you Sitkum!!

                        They exceeded our expectations, and were very professional. Our home is the oldest continuously occupied home in Clallam County, and is on the National Register, built in 1861. The trees and plants growing are very old and unique, but also some newer. Our English Walnut tree is well over 100 years, but the 100’ hedge of Leland Cedars is maybe 30 years old, tops. Each one needed distinct, separate care, and Connor, Eric and their Crew delivered that, in spades!

                        I needed an estimate of my huge diseased cherry tree to get pruned. Conor was SO incredibly patient with me and my ignorant questions. Ultimately he said that pruning would be stressful for the tree, and gave wonderful suggestions about how it should be watered for the next year to help the tree to endure the disease. Then gave me suggestions as to who to contact for potential pesticide spray.<br>
                        He spent a good 1/2 hour with me at no charge! He could easily have scheduled the pruning I thought I needed. He is honest, caring and ultimately forthcoming.

                        We had a HUGE tree project, over 50 trees to cut. Some near power lines, some on steep slopes, some near my husbands workshop, some leaning, some damaged. Basically every situation you might need to call tree people for. We aimed to get 3 estimates, got two (one guy was just too small an operation for this job) and went with Sitkum.<br>
                        Conor came out to go over the work with my husband, then came back with his FULL crew to review again before estimating. They were all super professional down to their matching shirts. I know that seems like a small factor but to me it says, this is not a rag tag crew, this is a TEAM. And indeed they were. They worked here for about a week straight, on time every day. Communication was great, the work was clean, safe, efficient and impressive. My husband was amazed at the dexterity of their work. We had much of the wood chipped and either spread or left in piles. Several dozen logs we wanted to keep for firewood were stacked neatly in our orchard.<br>
                        Don't think they only do big jobs, they also cut down just 3 trees for a friend who also rated them highly.
