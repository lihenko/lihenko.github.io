                    <div class="text-base mb-8"><p>When having our first initial consultation call with Ms L in Feb 2022 it was clear that she wanted to scale her Onlyfans page and make more money but had little to no idea how to. Ms L stressed that she did not want to sign with an agency and wanted to manage her page but with the help of chatters. Her strategy was mainly sending out 1 PPV per day and replying to direct messages from fans a few times a week. Her monthly statements were never higher than $2000 per month and retention levels were extremely low. She had 300 organic fans on her page and did not follow back any of her expired fans and therefore could no longer send them content, invite them back for a trial period or upsell in general.</p></div>

                        <p>The initial phase included an analysis of Ms LL’s content, expired fan count for follow back and putting together a full time chatter team.</p> 

                        <p>Once Ms L created the content that is required by the chatters to generate more consistent sales we were all systems go! We invited back mostly of all of her 3,000 expired subscribers within a few days, and were able to sell these old subscribers the new content in which the model created. This gave the model the time to finally start her Tiktok and focus on her already growing socials without the stress of having to engage with new and current fans. </p>

                        <p>We knew Ms L had a ton of expired fans so we applied our follow back tool to bring back 90% of her expired fans so that the chatters could sell them the new content.

                The whole process working with ConvoBunny was so helpful and effective. The sudden increase in sales on my page allowed me to gain more financial freedom and finally move away from webcam! I never thought I could see my page scale so quickly and it was quite unbelievable actually! ConvoBunny not only added chatters to my page, but they gave their expert advice on how I should best create content that increases sales and fan retention. I have never seen so many renewals as I always struggled to keep fans on my page. It was amazing to see my page jump from $1600 in one month to $20000 in less than 3 months, I would have never been able to achieve these numbers working alone plus trying to grow my social media and make new content at the same time
