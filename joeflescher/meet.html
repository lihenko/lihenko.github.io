							I know many of you may be more familiar remembering me as “Deputy Joe”, and wanted to let you know that as your County Commissioner, I am equally vigilant on your behalf.  It is my hope that on Election Day you take the opportunity to get out there and exercise your right to vote.  I’ve listened to your concerns, and we have weathered a few “storms” together over the past 16 years.  We have the opportunity to help our county through these challenging economic times.  I am ready to help sustain this recovery by continuing to be fiscally responsible, to help our government become more business-friendly and to create better job opportunities.  And throughout, we will, together, make sure that Indian River County continues to be a safe place to live.  You are why I enjoy doing this job every day.  You are the reason we need to always be fiscally responsible with YOUR money.  It’s been my honor to serve you as your County Commissioner since 2006.  And, we have much more to accomplish in the next 4 years.  Please give me the opportunity to keep serving your needs.  And remember, I am always open to your input on the issues.
